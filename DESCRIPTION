Description: Methods for simulating genealogies and estimating parameters for a 
    speciation and extinction coalescent process such that 1) disadvantageous 
    alleles appear continuously in a population and are present in mutation/selection 
    balance; 2) non-equilibrium dynamics of advantageous alleles which appear 
    continuously and grow in frequency.
